# Aggregate Functions in SQL

1. **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows in a column.
2. **SUM()**: Calculates the sum of the values in a column.
3. **MAX()**: Finds the largest value in a column.
4. **MIN()**: Finds the smallest value in a column.
5. **AVG()**: Calculates the average of the values in a column.
6. **ROUND()**: Rounds the values in a column.

- **GROUP BY**: Used with aggregate functions to group rows by one or more columns.
- **HAVING**: Filters the results based on an aggregate property (e.g., SUM > 100).
  
Aggregate functions help combine multiple rows into a single meaningful value.
