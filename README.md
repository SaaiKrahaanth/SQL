# SQL:
 The language you use to communicate with a database.

# TYPES OF SQL COMMANDS

 - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Commands to manipulate data in a database (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`).  
 - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Commands to define or modify database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).  
 - **DCL (Data Control Language):** Commands to control database access (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).  
 - **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Commands to manage transactions (e.g., `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`).

# MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite: 
 Database Management Systems (DBMSs) that use SQL to manage and store data but each with unique features, optimizations, and use cases.

 # Database Systems Comparison

 ## 1. **MySQL** 
   - **Type**: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
   - **Key Feature**: Stores data in tables (rows and columns), uses SQL for querying.
   - **Best For**: Web applications, blogs, content management systems (like WordPress).

## 2. **PostgreSQL**
   - **Type**: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
   - **Key Feature**: Supports advanced features like JSON, complex queries, and custom data types.
   - **Best For**: Enterprise applications, complex data structures, and analytics
   -
## 3. **SQLite**
   - **Type**: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
   - **Key Feature**: Serverless, lightweight, and stores the entire database in a single file.
   - **Best For**: Mobile apps, small projects, embedded systems, or desktop applications.

## 4. **MongoDB**
   - **Type**: NoSQL Database
   - **Key Feature**: Stores data in collections of documents (similar to JSON format), not in tables.
   - **Best For**: Applications needing flexible schema, fast data retrieval, and scalability (like social media apps).
